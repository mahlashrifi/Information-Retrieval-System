Developed for the Information Retrieval course instructed by Dr. Ahmad Nikabadi in Fall 2022

  

## Development Phases

The project unfolded in two phases:

  

### Phase 1

tasks

  

-  **Data Preprocessing**:

-  **Normalization**: Using the `hazm` library, the text is normalized to handle different variations of words
-  **Removing Punctuation**: Eliminating punctuation marks from the text.

-  **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual tokens or words.

-  **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "wants" and "wanted" to "want").

-  **Stop Words Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., "the", "and").

  
  

### Phase 2

In the second phase, the focus was on improving retrieval effectiveness and optimizing the index:

  

-  **Enhancing Retrieval Effectiveness**:

-  **TF-IDF Scoring**: Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to rank documents.
-  **Cosine Similarity**: Implementing cosine similarity to measure the similarity between query and document vectors.

-  **Index Optimization**:

-  **Champion Lists**: Creating champion lists to speed up query processing.
